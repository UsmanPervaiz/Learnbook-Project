Welcome To LearnBook

created by Naz Khan and Usman Pervaiz

The goal of this project was to emulate facebook functionality using our skills in Rails.
This project consists of zero JavaScript as we had not learned much to confidently
implement it.

Login Screen

![Alt text](./screenshots/login.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

Our LearnBook logo was created using Adobe Illustrator with the help of our good friend and colleague, Peter Chicarielli.

Our User log-in feature utilizes some simple validations to check for password length,
alphanumeric combinations, on top of bcrypt for password encryption and authentication.

Landing Page

The landing page is pretty simple but you can see the navbar up top which can guide
the user to their desired destination.

Profile page

This is what the profile page looks like.
